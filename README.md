<!-- Aflam
Website is made using html5, css3, bootstrap 4 (html css framework), jquery (javascript library it is used for toggle side nav bar and top navbar). You can see in main.js file I used two functions for it.

In the home page you can see I used bootstrap 4 grid system.
You can see I used (col-lg-4 class name) . it is predefined class in bootstrap.min.css. It will cover 25% width for larger screen. As you can see lg stands for large screen.
And other col-md-6 (means 50% with for medium devices).
And after medium devices width becomes to 100% for small devices.

You can see in style.css I used custom css for movie card.
Its easy you can easily understand.
Get started with Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with BootstrapCDN and a template starter page.(bootstrap4 on google). -->
